# Pronoun Resolver

A Claude Code hook that detects ambiguous references in user prompts and flags them for resolution. Zero-latency detection via regex/heuristics — Claude resolves using its own conversation context.

No LLM calls. No external API keys. Fires on every message, produces output only when ambiguity is detected.

## The Problem

When you type "fix it", Claude has to guess what "it" refers to. Sometimes it guesses right. Sometimes it confidently refactors the wrong file.

When you type "Make good" with no context, Claude may invent an interpretation rather than asking.

This hook makes the ambiguity visible so Claude asks instead of guessing.

## How It Works

```
User types: "fix it"
                |
    +-----------v-----------+
    |  Hook: detect-pronouns |
    |  (regex + heuristic)   |
    |  ~0ms, no LLM calls    |
    +-----------+-----------+
                | ambiguity detected
    +-----------v-----------+
    |  Output: flags +       |
    |  compact preamble      |
    +-----------+-----------+
                |
    +-----------v-----------+
    |  Claude receives:      |
    |  [PRONOUN-RESOLVER: Resolve using context. HIGH=act. LOW=ask.]  |
    |  [AMBIGUOUS: pronouns="it" | type=pronoun]                      |
    |  fix it                |
    +--------------------+---+
                |
    +-----------v-----------+
    |  Claude resolves using |
    |  conversation context  |
    |  (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)    |
    +------------------------+
```

Claude is the resolver. It has the conversation context. The hook just makes ambiguity explicit.

## Detection Categories

### 1. Personal Pronouns (always flagged)

`it`, `them`, `they`, `its`

These are always referential — they can't be determiners.

### 2. Demonstratives (smart filtering)

`this`, `that`, `these`, `those`

Only flagged when used as standalone pronouns, NOT as determiners:

| Prompt | Flagged? | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| `fix this` | Yes | "this" is standalone, no object |
| `fix this bug` | No | "this" is a determiner for "bug" |
| `do that and deploy` | Yes | "that" followed by conjunction |
| `update that file` | No | "that" is a determiner for "file" |
| `these tests are failing` | No | "these" is a determiner for "tests" |

### 3. Vague Referents

`other`, `something`, `someone`, `somewhere`, `anything`, `everything`, `stuff`

### 4. Bare Imperatives (implicit subject)

Detected when no pronouns or vague words are found. Catches commands with no explicit object:

| Prompt | Detected | Subtype |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `Fix` | Yes | bare_verb |
| `Make good` | Yes | verb_adjective |
| `Make better/faster` | Yes | verb_adjective |
| `Clean up` | Yes | verb_adjective |
| `Fix the bug` | No | has explicit object |
| `Add tests` | No | has noun object |

## Resolution Tiering

When Claude sees flags, it applies this framework:

| Tier | Confidence | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| GREEN | 90%+ | Resolve silently, just act |
| YELLOW | 70-90% | State assumption in one line, then act |
| RED | <70% | Ask the user before acting |
| BLACK | No context | Always ask (first message bare imperative) |

## Self-Learning Ledger

Resolution accuracy is tracked at `.claude/pronoun-ledger.json`. When Claude resolves a reference, it logs the result. When the user corrects it, the entry is marked and confidence calibration adjusts.

```json
{
  "resolutions": [],
  "resolution_count": 0,
  "adaptive_threshold": 0.8,
  "context_reliability": {}
}
```

## File Structure

```
pronoun-resolver/
  SKILL.md                  # Skill definition + resolution framework
  bin/
    detect-pronouns.sh      # Hook entry point — regex + orchestration
    detect-implicit.py      # Bare imperative heuristic detector
```

## Install

### 1. Clone/symlink the skill

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaicianflone/coding-pronoun-prompt-resolver.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/coding-pronoun-prompt-resolver" ~/.claude/skills/pronoun-resolver
```

### 2. Add the hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/.claude/skills/pronoun-resolver/bin/detect-pronouns.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace the path with your actual absolute path. The hook requires an absolute path.

## Configuration

### Disable for a project

```bash
mkdir -p .claude && touch .claude/pronoun-resolver-disabled
```

### Re-enable

```bash
rm .claude/pronoun-resolver-disabled
```

### Reset the ledger

```bash
rm .claude/pronoun-ledger.json
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+ (for bare imperative detection)
- Bash 4+ (for arrays)
- Claude Code with hooks support
